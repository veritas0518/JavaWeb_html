# JavaWeb_html
Today, nothing special happened. What should I do or what should I do? However, I learned very fast in the web stage. I have finished learning all servlets. Later, I began to work on a Book City project. I just learned it. I feel very low. To tell the truth, I still fell behind a lot in my junior year. I have to speed up my pace to catch up, but I can't help it, I just started teaching Java in the first half of my junior year. I didn't know the importance of reading at that time. Now I wake up and want to learn. I can't say it's too late. I still have about a year to learn. But there are algorithms. This thing is really disgusting. You must have a little talent to learn it. Those without talent can basically be eliminated soon. I just want to be a java development engineer in the future. Can I transfer to big data until I can get a master's degree. Now I can only learn step by step. My only advantage may be my age. Ha ha, it's really ironic. I can't help feeling that it makes heroes cry.
